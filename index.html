                    Hi, My name is Yagya Bahadur Niroula. I'm currently pursuing a Post Graduate in Mobile Application Development at Georgian College.
                    I don't have much experience in Web Design and Application Development, but I am eager to learn and grow in this field.

            <h2>My Favorite App
                <i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Talking about my favorite app, I would say it is "Spotify". I love listening to music and Spotify provides a great platform for discovering new songs and artists.      
                The user interface is intuitive and the app is easy to navigate. I also appreciate the personalized playlists and recommendations that Spotify offers, making it a great tool for music lovers like me.
                I enjoy exploring different genres and discovering new music, and Spotify makes that experience enjoyable and seamless.
